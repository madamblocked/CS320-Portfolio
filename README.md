# CS_320-Portfolio
Adam Conger

This class was a great opportunity to increase my capabilities in terms of how I develop software. JUnit testing is intuitive, language-supported, and easy to learn and understand for your Java files. I think down the line I will really get used to developing test cases in line with my Java applications. It seems logical to do that. But it will come down to getting better at JUnit to ensure that I continue to develop secure code.

The projects in the portfolio demonstrate how we've been exposed to gathering user requirements. Each module had specific requirements with relation to the string fields in each of the Java files. In tandem with wanting to develop in accordance with requirements, it's inherent that Test Cases are appropriately added and developed for -- such as error exceptions for null strings or strings that are too long.
